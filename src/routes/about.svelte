		A talented backend developer, Marcus is I dare say fluent in code. It's fun to watch his mind at
		work. It's like watching a pilot fly a giant airplane. You think it could not possibly take off,
		yet all of a sudden it's rising as if it's light as a feather. The guy is sharp, well-read,
		curious and has a wicked sense of humour. He is also humble, kind and caring, never refusing a
		request for help, however seemingly insignificant and however little time he has, while
		delivering his own projects on time and beyond expectation. Working with Marcus has been a rare
		pleasure.
